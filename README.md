# Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Implementation Guide

## Prompting Methods Overview
**Input-Output (IO) Prompting**<br>
A straightforward method for simple interactions[1]
```python
prompt = "What's the capital of France?"
# Direct Response: "Paris"
```

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**<br>
Breaks down complex reasoning into logical steps[1]
```python
prompt = """
Calculate the total cost of 3 books at $12.99 with 8% tax.
Let's solve this step by step:
"""
```

## ToT Core Components

**Thought Generation**
```python
def generate_thoughts(self, question: str, current_thought: str = "", n_samples: int = 3) -> List[str]:
    prompt = f"""You are a logical thinker and math problem solver. 
    Given a question and current thought, list {n_samples} possible next steps."""
    return thoughts[:n_samples]
```

**Evaluation System**
```python
def evaluate_thought(self, question: str, thought: str, cache: bool = True) -> float:
    prompt = f"Question: {question}\nPartial reasoning:\n{thought}\n"
    return score
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Standard Method | ToT Method |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Game of 24 Success | 4% | 74% |

## Technical Requirements

**Hardware Needs**
- High computational power
- Large memory allocation
- Complex system integration capabilities

**Implementation Challenges**
- Resource-intensive processing
- Complex system requirements
- Risk of branch over-focusing
- Careful configuration needed

## Optimal Applications

**Best Use Cases**
- Strategic planning with multiple paths
- Complex mathematical reasoning
- Creative writing projects
- Multi-variable optimization
- Interconnected decision-making scenarios

The ToT framework particularly excels in scenarios requiring deep exploration and structured decision-making, though implementation should be carefully considered based on available computational resources.
